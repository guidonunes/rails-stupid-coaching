# Stupid Coach Challenge

## Overview

The Stupid Coach challenge is a simple Rails-based web application where a user can ask a question to a "coach" and receive a response based on predefined logic. This project aims to help you get familiar with building a basic Rails app, handling HTTP requests, and managing form submissions. The application consists of two pages: a form where users ask questions and a result page where users see their question and the coach’s answer.

## Objective

Implement a simple Rails application with two pages:

* Question Form Page: The user can input a question for the coach.
* Answer Page: After submitting the form, the user is redirected to a page where their question is displayed along with the coach's (often humorous) response.

## Features

* Form Submission: The user enters a question into a form.
* Coach's Response: Based on the content of the question, the coach replies with an appropriate (but "stupid") answer.
* User Redirection: After submitting a question, the user is redirected to a new page displaying both the question and the coach’s response.

## User Stories

* As a user, I can ask the coach a question using a form.
* As a user, I want to see my question and the coach's response after submitting the form.

## Stack

* Ruby on Rails: The web framework used to handle form submissions, routing, and rendering views.
* HTML/CSS: For building and styling the form and result pages.
